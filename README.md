## Interacting with the contract
You need to have `casper-client` and `jq` installed on your system to run the examples. The instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS.

### Install the prerequisites

You can install the required software by issuing the following commands. If you are on an up-to-date Casper node, you probably already have all of the prerequisites installed so you can skip this step.

```bash
# Update package repositories
sudo apt update

# Install the command-line JSON processor
sudo apt install jq -y

# Install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

#Install the nightly version (by default stable toolchain is installed)
rustup install nightly

#Check that nightly toolchain version is installed(this will list stable and nightly versions)
rustup toolchain list

#Set rust nightly as default
rustup default nightly

# Install wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

#Install Cmake
sudo apt-get -y install cmake

#For other platforms: https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html

#Installing the Casper Crates
cargo install cargo-casper

# Add Casper repository
echo "deb https://repo.casperlabs.io/releases" bionic main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/casper.list
curl -O https://repo.casperlabs.io/casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt-key add casper-repo-pubkey.ascr
sudo apt update

# To check Casper Client Version
casper-client --version

# Commands for help
casper-client --help
casper-client <command> --help
```

### Creating Keys

```bash
# Create keys
casper-client keygen <TARGET DIRECTORY>
```

### Usage
To run the Contracts make sure you are in the folder of your required contract.
#### Install
Make sure `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is installed.
```
make prepare
```

It's also recommended to have [wasm-strip](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
available in your PATH to reduce the size of compiled Wasm.

#### Build Individual Smart Contract
Run this command to build Smart Contract.
```
make build-contract
```
<br>**Note:** User needs to be in the desired project folder to build contracts and User needs to run `make build-contract` in every project to make wasms to avoid errors

#### Build All Smart Contracts
Run this command in main folder to build all Smart Contract.
```
make all
```

#### Individual Test Cases
Run this command to run Test Cases.
```
make test
```
<br>**Note:** User needs to be in the desired project folder to run test cases

#### All Test Cases
Run this command in main folder to run all contract's Test Cases.
```
make test
```

### Known contract hashes

All contracts have already being deployed. Inorder to interact with the specific contract you need to call it by its hash. The table below contains the contract hash (without the `hash-` prefix) for all the contracts on public Casper networks:

Network| Contract Name | Account info contract hash
---|---|---
Testnet| ERC20 | `hash-279445c140615fd511759dfb96c610dee212769913f61a57b0f9dde42d6a8d10`
Testnet| WCSPR | `hash-4f2d1b772147b9ce3706919fe0750af6964249b0931e2115045f97e1e135e80b`
Testnet| FLASHSWAPPER | ` hash-1c23f9e89033e5c2d2a21a6926411b2645c000cf43fc0db495821633da2aed6e`
Testnet| PAIR | `hash-de6ba94b699dad44e12bf98e35c1122eed7dba9eed8af6d8952875afaec8c7dd`
Testnet| FACTORY | `hash-13cc83616c3fb4e6ea22ead5e61eb6319d728783ed02eab51b1f442085e605a7`


### Deploying ERC20 contract manually

If you need to deploy the `ERC20 contract` manually you need to pass the some parameters. Following is the command to deploy the `ERC20 contract`.

```bash
sudo casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name chain_name \
    --node-address http://$NODE_ADDRESS:7777/ \
    --secret-key path_to_secret_key.pem \
    --session-path path_to_wasm_file \
    --payment-amount 10000000000 \
    --session-arg="public_key:public_key='Public Key In Hex'" \
    --session-arg="name:string='token-name'" \
    --session-arg="symbol:string='token-symbol'" \
    --session-arg="decimals:u8='unsigned integer value'" \
    --session-arg="initial_supply:u256='unsigned integer value'" \
    --session-arg="contract_name:string='contract_name'"
```

## Entry Point methods <a id="erc20-entry-point-methods"></a>

Following are the ERC20's entry point methods.

- #### transfer <a id="erc20-transfer"></a>
Lets ` self.get_caller() ` send pool tokens to a recipient hash.

Following is the table of parameters.

Parameter Name | Type
---|---
recipient | Key
amount | U256


This method **returns** nothing.

- #### transfer_from <a id="erc20-transfer-from"></a>

### Deploying FLASH SWAPPER contract manually

If you need to deploy the `Flash swapper contract` manually you need to pass the hashes of the other contracts as parameter. Following is the command to deploy the `Flash Swapper contract`.

```bash
sudo casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name chain_name \
    --node-address http://$NODE_ADDRESS:7777/ \
    --secret-key path_to_secret_key.pem \
    --session-path path_to_wasm_file \
    --payment-amount 10000000000 \
    --session-arg="public_key:public_key='Public Key In Hex'" \
    --session-arg="uniswap_v2_factory:Key='Hash of factory Contract'" \
    --session-arg="wcspr:Key='Hash of WCSPR Contract'" \
    --session-arg="dai:Key='Hash of DAI Contract'" \
    --session-arg="contract_name:string='contract_name'"
```

Before deploying `Flash Swapper Contract`, you would need to deploy other contracts first and pass hashes of these contracts to the respective parameters above. We have already deployed these contracts and the tables belows displays the hashes of the contracts.

Name | Network | Account info contract hash
---|---|---
Factory | Testnet | `hash-13cc83616c3fb4e6ea22ead5e61eb6319d728783ed02eab51b1f442085e605a7`

## Entry Point methods <a id="flashswapper-entry-point-methods"></a>

Following are the Flash Swapper's entry point methods.

- #### start_swap <a id="flashswapper-start-swap"></a>
This method will start swap.
<br>Special Instructions: The user needs to call this (start_swap) method first to call the `uniswap_v2_call` method.
`Start_swap` method will further call 3 methods
- simple_flash_loan
This method will be invoked if both tokens (token_borrow and token_pay) are the same.
- simple_flash_swap
This method will be invoked if both tokens (token_borrow and token_pay) are not the same. one of them must be equal to
“Hash-0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000”
- triangular_flash_swap
This method will be invoked if both tokens (token_borrow and token_pay) are not the same.
The above mthods will invoke the swap methods of `Pair` Contract by using the `permissioned_pair_address`. And then the `swap` method will invoke the `uniswap_v2_call` method.

Following is the table of parameters.

Parameter Name | Type
---|---
token_borrow | Key
amount | U256
token_pay | Key
user_data | String

This method **returns** nothing.


- #### uniswap_v2_call <a id="flashswapper-uniswap-v2-call"></a>
This method is called by `swap` method of `pair contract`.
<br>the sender must be a `Flash Swapper Contract` hash if user data has some value.
`Uniswap_v2_call` must be called from a contract. Users cannot directly invoke this method.


Following is the table of parameters.

Parameter Name | Type
---|---
sender | Key
amount0 | U256
amount1 | U256
data | String

This method **returns** nothing.
